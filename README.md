# Cerlebration Bot

Our team consisted of Eugene, Mitch, Leah, Sieun, Michelle, Freddy, and Olena. 

We were working on the Celebration Bot. We designed an app for Slack that integrates all the data
about birthdays and anniversaries within the company and greets your colleagues right in their 
special day. We made the bot to manage most of the important stuff himself. He collects a list of 
birthdays automatically, reminds about upcoming birthdays and anniversaries automatically and 
congratulates people automatically as well.
 
Our Celebration Bot reminds about birthdays and anniversaries using animated company's symbol.
With our Celebration Bot you can be sure you wonâ€™t miss the important date!
